# Assignment instructions

This is a real codebase — a Netlify-deployed 404 page backed by a serverless function. You're adding features to it, not building something from scratch. Read the code before you write any.

---

## What you're building

Two features, one each for two tracks:

**Track 1 — front-end feature:** add something to the 404 page (or both pages) that makes the experience more engaging. Examples: dark mode toggle, clipboard share button, roast history for the session. You have full creative latitude on what to build. The security guardrails in `docs/reference/security-guardrails.md` apply regardless.

**Track 2 — back-end security feature:** add a security improvement to `netlify/functions/insult.mjs`. Must include vitest tests. Examples: prompt injection prevention via path sanitization, structured error logging, input validation, response caching with fallback. The feature must not weaken any existing security check.

Both tracks follow the same workflow: propose → spec → implement → verify. You don't write code until a spec is approved.

---

## Before you start

You should have:

- A [Netlify account](https://netlify.com) (free)
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) (free tier) set in the Netlify dashboard
- Node.js installed (v22 or later)
- The Netlify CLI installed: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
- Git and a GitHub account

---

## Part 1 — Set up your fork

1. Fork this repo on GitHub and clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hap-silly-404.git
   cd hap-silly-404
   ```

2. Install dev dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Log in to the Netlify CLI and link your fork to a Netlify site:

   ```bash
   netlify login
   netlify link
   ```

   If you don't have a Netlify site yet, run `netlify sites:create` first and give it a name. Then run `netlify link` and choose "Use current git remote origin."

4. Start the local dev server:

   ```bash
   netlify dev
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:8888/404` in your browser. Confirm the page loads and a roast appears. If the roast sounds canned ("You typed something. The server looked. Nothing.") rather than freshly generated, that's fine — it means `GROQ_API_KEY` isn't wired up yet. The function is still running correctly. Live roasts require the key to be set in the Netlify dashboard and the site to be linked.

6. Read `AGENTS.md` before opening Copilot Chat. It is the contract between you and your AI agent. The security rules in it are non-negotiable.

---

## Part 2 — Add vitest

Before reading the tutorials or starting either track, get vitest running:

1. Install vitest as a dev dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev vitest
   ```

2. Open `package.json` and add two entries to the `scripts` block:

   ```json
   "test": "vitest run",
   "test:watch": "vitest"
   ```

   Both `tests/` and `specs/` folders are already in the repo. `tests/` is where your vitest files go. `specs/` is where your approved spec files go, one per feature.

3. Run vitest to confirm the setup:

   ```bash
   npx vitest
   ```

   It should start and report zero tests found. That is correct — you haven't written any yet.

4. Read `docs/tutorials/tdd-with-vitest.md` before writing any tests.

---

## Part 3 — Read the tutorials

Read all of these before starting either track. They build on each other — reading order matters.

1. `docs/tutorials/serverless-functions-101.md` — what `insult.mjs` is and how Netlify runs it; essential context for Track 2
2. `docs/tutorials/es-modules-in-the-browser.md` — why `type="module"` matters and what module scope means for your code
3. `docs/tutorials/environment-variables-and-secrets.md` — the three-tier config model: dashboard, `netlify dev`, `process.env`
4. `docs/tutorials/cors-is-hard-and-everyone-hates-it.md` — why CORS exists, the five errors you'll see, and how this repo handles it
5. `docs/tutorials/local-debugging-with-devtools-and-netlify-dev.md` — the two-window workflow, how to read function logs, six real failure mode walkthroughs
6. `docs/tutorials/hardening-walkthrough-applying-each-audit-fix.md` — every security change made to this codebase and why; read this before Track 2
7. `docs/tutorials/csp-for-front-end-features.md` — what the CSP means for every new script, style, image, or fetch you add; essential context for Track 1
8. `docs/tutorials/graceful-degradation-fallback-pattern.md` — the four fallback layers in `insult.mjs`; how to apply the pattern to new features
9. `docs/tutorials/secretlint-keeping-secrets-out-of-git.md` — how the pre-commit hook works and what to do when it fires
10. `docs/tutorials/openspec-spec-driven-development.md` — the spec workflow and how to use Copilot within it
11. `docs/tutorials/tdd-with-vitest.md` — the red/green cycle, test setup, and the three tests you'll use as a starting point

---

## Part 4 — Track 1: front-end feature

1. Open Copilot Chat. Describe your feature idea in plain language. Ask Copilot to ask you clarifying questions before doing anything else.

2. Ask Copilot to write a spec. See `docs/tutorials/openspec-spec-driven-development.md` for what a complete spec looks like.

3. Review the spec against `docs/reference/security-guardrails.md`. Edit it until it's right. Then save it as a file — `specs/your-feature-name.md` — and approve it explicitly in writing: "looks good, let's implement." Copilot reads this file at the start of each session, so it doesn't lose track of what you agreed to.

4. Ask Copilot to implement against the approved spec. CSS, HTML, and client-side JavaScript are yours to redesign as needed. The security guardrails apply regardless of what you build.

5. Run `npm run check`. Fix anything it reports. The pre-commit hook runs this automatically on `git commit`, but running it manually first saves time.

---

## Part 5 — Track 2: back-end security feature

1. Open Copilot Chat. Propose a security improvement to `insult.mjs`. Review the existing handler order in `AGENTS.md` before proposing — new checks should slot into the existing flow, not restructure it.

2. Ask Copilot to write a spec. The spec must include a Tests section listing what each test covers. See `docs/tutorials/openspec-spec-driven-development.md` for an example.

3. Review the spec against `docs/reference/security-guardrails.md`. Save it as `specs/your-feature-name.md` and approve it before any code is written.

4. Write the tests first. Create a test file in `tests/`. Run `npm run test:watch` and confirm the tests fail (red) before you write the implementation.

5. Implement the feature against the spec. Watch the tests go green.

6. Run `npm test` and `npm run check`. Both must pass before you consider the feature complete.

---

## Keeping AGENTS.md current

`AGENTS.md` is a living document. It starts as a set of rules for this repo. It should grow as you work.

After you finish each spec, look at the constraints you wrote in the "out of scope" section. If any of those constraints should apply permanently — not just to this feature — add them to `AGENTS.md` as rules. Copilot reads this file at the start of every session. Rules you add now prevent the same mistake in the next session.

Effective rules are specific and include a reason. Compare:

```
# vague — Copilot will interpret this loosely
Don't break the security stuff.

# effective — Copilot knows exactly what to do and why
Never pass unsanitized URL path values into the Groq prompt string —
prompt injection is a real attack vector even in a 404 page.
```

Useful patterns to follow:

- `Never [action] — [one-line reason]`
- `Always [action] before [trigger]`
- `If [condition], [action] instead of [default]`
- `When adding [thing], insert at [location] rather than [alternative]`

You don't need to add a rule after every commit. Add one when you catch yourself making the same decision twice, when something went wrong and you want to prevent a repeat, or when a spec constraint feels permanent enough to belong here.

## Deliverables

- Track 1 feature live on your Netlify deploy URL
- Track 2 feature with passing vitest tests
- `npm run check` passes (no lint, format, or secretlint errors)
- `npm test` passes
- Your spec existed before your implementation — Copilot Chat history is sufficient evidence
