# Assignment checklist

## Setup

- [ ] Fork and clone the repo
- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Run `netlify login` and `netlify link`
- [ ] Run `netlify dev` — confirm `http://localhost:8888/404` loads with a roast
- [ ] Read `AGENTS.md`

## Vitest and specs

- [ ] Run `npm install --save-dev vitest`
- [ ] Add `"test": "vitest run"` to `package.json` scripts
- [ ] Add `"test:watch": "vitest"` to `package.json` scripts
- [ ] Confirm `tests/` and `specs/` folders exist (both ship with the repo)
- [ ] Run `npx vitest` — confirm it starts (zero tests is fine)
